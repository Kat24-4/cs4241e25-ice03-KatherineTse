Instructions: 
- When you load the page, a plane start page will appear. Click anywhere to start the program.
- Ensure that your volume is on so that you can hear the music that is controlling the animation.
- On the right side there are controls for three aspects of the shape 
  - y: you can use the slider to change the y position of the shape (the shape rotates around the x-axis, and you can control the shapes position on the y-axis)
  - color: you can change the color of the object by inputting a hex code or clicking on the colored square which will open a color picker 
  - shininess: you can use the slider to change how shiny the object is (it goes from matte to very shiny)
